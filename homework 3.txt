In this assignment, I created a Docker image for my Django movie application.
I wrote a Dockerfile specifying Python 3.11 and installed all dependencies using requirements.txt.
I then built the image with docker build -t movie-app . and ran it using
docker run -p 8001:8000 -d movie-app.
The app successfully ran in a Docker container and was accessible on http://localhost:8001.


FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt /app
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . /app
CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8001"]
